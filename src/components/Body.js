          This Privacy Policy was last updated on February 17, 2017. Welcome to
          the Y Combinator website (including all subdomains, the “Site”), which
          is operated by Y Combinator Management, LLC and its affiliates
          (collectively, “Y Combinator,” “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site
          provides, among other things, information about our people,
          organization and application process, tools for applicants to submit
          applications and go through the application process, forums for
          discussions about topics relevant to startups, and profiles of
          founders and companies who have participated in the Y Combinator
          program. This Privacy Policy sets forth Y Combinator’s policy with
          respect to personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and certain
          other information that is collected from users of the Site.
          Information We Collect: When you interact with us through the Site, we
          may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further
          described below: Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site: We
          collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such
          information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, register an
          account with us or submit an application to us. By voluntarily
          providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it
          in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data
          to us, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be
          transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Y
          Combinator and the authorized third parties referred to herein located
          in the United States. Other Information: Non-Identifiable Data: When
          you interact with Y Combinator through the Site, we receive and store
          certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information
          cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Y Combinator
          may store such information itself or such information may be included
          in databases owned and maintained by Y Combinator affiliates, agents
          or service providers. We may use such information and pool it with
          other information to track, for example, the characteristics of
          businesses that apply to or are accepted by Y Combinator, and we may
          publish or otherwise disclose such aggregated information. Aggregated
          Personal Data: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the
          users of the Site, Y Combinator may conduct research on the
          characteristics of such users, including but not limited to user
          demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and
          other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and
          analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Y Combinator may publish or
          otherwise disclose such aggregated information. This aggregate
          information does not identify you personally. Analytics and Tracking
          Technologies: We may, and we may allow third party service providers
          to, use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about
          your browsing activities over time and across different websites
          following your use of the Site. For example, we use Google Analytics,
          a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google
          Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Site and
          enhance your experience when you use the Site. For more information on
          how Google uses this data, go to
          www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. On most web browsers, you
          will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this
          section for information on how to receive notification when you are
          receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that
          you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage
          of some of the Site’s features. Our Site currently does not respond to
          “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals and operates as described in this Privacy
          Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the
          future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.
